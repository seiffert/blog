# This will be my Blog (someday).

I decided to create a blog for my own. There are many reasons for having a blog. For me, the two most important ones are:

* Learning a new technology (which obviously is Scala/Play for me)
* Writing about things I learn

Making this blog Open Source allows me to (hopefully) get some feedback on my first steps with Scala.

## Setup

1. Install Play
1. Clone this repository
1. Run the application using the play console
1. OR: deploy it on Heroku
